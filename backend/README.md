# Backend

## Manual installation

Create a `.env` file from template and edit its contents:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Build TypeScript files:

```
yarn build
```

Run the backend:

```
yarn start
```

### Development

If you want, you can use the following command
that automatically compiles TS and reloads the backend:

```
yarn dev
```
